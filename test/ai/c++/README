Running the sample
******************
The C++ sample code shows the use of the p3opensteer module.
The C++ samples uses the autotools build system, so could be surely
built on GNU/Linux using these commands within the "c++" folder:

  autoreconf -i -v -W no-all
  ./configure
  make
  
and executed with:

  ./<EXAMPLE_NAME>
  
However all the code should also compile successfully on other 
platforms (after suitably creating/modifying the "data.h" file that 
defines the global string variable "dataDir", i.e. the path to models' 
data).

NOTE: it should pointed out that the programming style and structure of 
the sample programs' code is not really favored by the author, but it 
is solely intended to test and to show the functionality exposed by the 
p3opensteer module.
