******************
*Ely Installation*
******************

Ely is a game development environment and, as such, it is not so trivial to install.
The overall environment is composed of many packages with interdependencies between them.
Some of these packages are supplied by the distribution (Debian or Ubuntu), while others 
are to be built manually.
Most manually installed packages, included Ely, uses 'GNU autotools' build system and are 
supplied in custom source repositories which are kept, as far as possible, up to date with 
the original ones (the only difference is the build system).
Moreover these custom repositories, included Ely, are in 'maintainer mode', meaning that you
need to use the full autotools suite to build the packages, although you can obtain distributable 
source packages (with make dist) which can be build with only the classic triad:

 $ configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
 
In the following instructions these conventions are used:
-the given order of installation should be followed (because of (inter)dependencies)
-packages are built into 'build-release' directories inside the source trees (but they 
can be anywhere in the filesystem)
-the $ sign means that commands are issued as normal user
-commands that could be run as root are prefixed with 'sudo' command

Mandatory packages
