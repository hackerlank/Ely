// Simple soccer game by Michael Holm, IO Interactive A/S
//
// I made this to learn opensteer, and it took me four hours. The players will
// hunt the ball with no team spirit, each player acts on his own accord.
//
// I challenge the reader to change the behavour of one of the teams, to beat my
// team. It should not be too hard. If you make a better team, please share the
// source code so others get the chance to create a team that'll beat yours :)
//
// You are free to use this code for whatever you please.
